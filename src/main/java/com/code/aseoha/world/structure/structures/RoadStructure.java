     * This method allows us to have mobs that spawn naturally over time in our structure.
     * No other mobs will spawn in the structure of the same entity classification.
     * The reason you want to match the classifications is so that your structure's mob
     * will contribute to that classification's cap. Otherwise, it may cause a runaway
     * spawning of the mob that will never stop.
     *
     * NOTE: getDefaultSpawnList is for monsters only and getDefaultCreatureSpawnList is
     *       for creatures only. If you want to add entities of another classification,
     *       use the StructureSpawnListGatherEvent to add water_creatures, water_ambient,
     *       ambient, or misc mobs. Use that event to add/remove mobs from structures
     *       that are not your own.
     *
     * NOTE 2: getSpecialEnemies and getSpecialAnimals are the vanilla methods that Forge does
     *         not hook up. Do not use those methods or else the mobs won't spawn. You would
     *         have to manually implement spawning for them. Stick with Forge's Default form
     *         as it is easier to use that.

     * This is where extra checks can be done to determine if the structure can spawn here.
     * This only needs to be overridden if you're adding additional spawn conditions.
     *
     * Fun fact, if you set your structure separation/spacing to be 0/1, you can use
     * isFeatureChunk to return true only if certain chunk coordinates are passed in
     * which allows you to spawn structures only at certain coordinates in the world.
     *
     * Notice how the biome is also passed in. Though, you are not going to
     * do any biome checking here as you should've added this structure to
     * the biomes you wanted already with the biome load event.
     *
     * Basically, this method is used for determining if the land is at a suitable height,
     * if certain other structures are too close or not, or some other restrictive condition.
     *
     * For example, Pillager Outposts added a check to make sure it cannot spawn within 10 chunk of a Village.
     * (Bedrock Edition seems to not have the same check)
     *
     *
     * Also, please for the love of god, do not do dimension checking here. If you do and
     * another mod's dimension is trying to spawn your structure, the locate
     * command will make minecraft hang forever and break the game.
     *
     * Instead, use the addDimensionalSpacing method in StructureTutorialMain class.
     * If you check for the dimension there and do not add your structure's
     * spacing into the chunk generator, the structure will not spawn in that dimension!
